Next steps:
* Check voltage values on doepfer gate
	* build common ground
	* possible need safety resistor from doepfer hot value to arduino A0 input
		* 27 - 47k ohm resistor in series with port pin
* Javascript: 
	* delta value
	* threshold

Possibly needed:
* debounce
	* https://lodash.com/docs#debounce
